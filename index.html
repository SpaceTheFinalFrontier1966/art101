			<p>So I'm Philip, a person of sorts. You can usually pick me out in a class by being one that talks and jokes at random times. So, yeah. What else do I write here? I don't know. Let's say something in Black Speech! Ash nazg durbatul√ªk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatul√ªk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul. True fans know what i just said. Anyway, all you need to know is I'm nerdy and weird. üëç</p>
			<p>So that was Latin, I guess.</p>
