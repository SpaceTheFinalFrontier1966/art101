		<h2>This is a secondary heading TDB. Why TBD? Because I haven't decided yet. Give me a minute.</h2>
		<p>So I'm Philip, a person of sorts. You can usually pick me out in a class by being one that talks and jokes at random times. So, yeah. What else do I write here? I don't know. Let's say something in Black Speech! Ash nazg durbatul√ªk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatul√ªk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul. True fans know what i just said. Anyway, all you need to know is I'm nerdy and weird. üëç</p>

		<p>So that was Latin, I guess.</p>

			<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>It was easy creating the file structure once I got the hang of it, but I had soem difficulty creating index.html files and making them work right.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Well you are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file structure that I made:</p>
