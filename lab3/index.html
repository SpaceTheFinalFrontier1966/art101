			<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
			<p>It was easy creating the file structure once I got the hang of it, but I had some difficulty creating index.html files and making them work right.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Well, here you go. This needed some modification, but I think I did it.</p>
