          <p>Working with my partner, we worked on the page until it looked oh so beautiful.</p>
          <h2>Challenges on the next line</h2>

          <p>Well, this page. Looks neat, right? (It does look neat, right? I'm assuming here. I haven't looked at it at the time of this writing. All I know for sure is that the picture of a Star Wars Middle-earth is gonna be huge.)</p>
