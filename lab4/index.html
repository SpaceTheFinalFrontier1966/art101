				<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
				<img src="img/Pseudo.png" width=650>
				<p>Working with your partner, we did some problem-solving and such, though it took me a bit more time to do that.</p>
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>It turns out I didn't have many of these sections here before, but that has since been solved. As is evidenced by this very segment being here.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I think the file looks alright. Could be worse. Actually no, pretty bad. I'll get on that this weekend.</p>
