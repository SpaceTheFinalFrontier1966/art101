          <p>Working with my partner, we experimented with anonymous functions and callbacks. It is wild.</p>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>Same challenge as always. My lack of knowledge can be a small impediment, but I don't think I'm failing yet.</p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>Well, go check out the console. Cool, right? Or is it not doing anything? If that's the case, then apologies. That's not good.</p>
